CATChem
==============

**CATChem**  (Configurable ATmospheric Chemistry) is a modelling
component that includes all chemical and aerosol processes needed to perform
atmospheric chemistry and composition simulations within a model through a
flexible, easy to modify, and well-documented infrastructure. CATChem will
include the following processes: chemical kinetics, aerosols, photolysis,
wet deposition, dry deposition, connections to emissions, and connection to
physics schemes. The first use of CATChem will be connecting it to NOAA's
Unified Forecasting System (https://ufscommunity.org/) to create UFS-Chem. CATChem and UFS-Chem are
currently under development and more information will be provided soon.


.. warning::
   CATChem is currently under development. The code is public to
   encourage collaboration amongst the community. Do not publish results using
   CATChem  without consulting the development team.
